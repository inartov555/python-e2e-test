## What it is
Automation framework (example).

## Note:
 - !!! This is just an example of the code; this framework cannot be used for testing Instagram or running multiple times !!!

## E2E Test Framework (Python + Pytest + Playwright)

Modern, scalable, and maintainable test framework built with **Pytest** and **Playwright** using **Page Object Model**,
OOP and SOLID principles.

## How to run

NOTE: When you start the source run_tests.sh script, it copies the project to another directory to avoid adding cached files, and the venv directory to the project folder. 

To start tests, you need:

1. Open as a logged-in user: (https://www.instagram.com/accounts/edit/).
2. Switch the "Show account suggestions on profiles" option OFF.
3. Follow at least one person who makes some posts.
4. Log out and then log in again.
5. Open a terminal window and run `sudo apt-get install libavif16`
6. Fill in [`pytest.ini`](./pytest.ini) parameters. 
   To set the `password` parameter, encrypt the account password using [`tools/temp_encr.py`](./tools/temp_encr.py).
7. Run the `run_tests.sh` file next way: `source run_tests.sh $PATH_TO_THE_PROJECT $PATH_TO_INI_CONFIG` (if you don't pass the ini config file, then the default one is used [`pytest.ini`](./pytest.ini)). 
   Copied project folder, run results like logs, etc., are located in: `/home/$user_name/TEST1/workspace`. 
   Artifacts (run results, logs, etc.) are located in: `/home/$user_name/TEST1/workspace/artifact`.

## Structure

```
python_pytest_playwright_e2e_test/
  src/
    core/          # config, browser, logging, base abstractions
    components/    # reusable UI components (PostCard)
    pages/         # Page Objects (public + private)
  tests/           # pytest tests
  artifacts/       # logs, test results, screenshots, videos, etc.
```

## Decisions & Rationale (Summary)

- **Playwright** chosen over Selenium for stability, auto-waits, tracing, and easier parallelism â€” reduces flakiness and 
  keeps PageObjects slim while still SOLID.
- **Page Object + Components**: complex parts of the feed are encapsulated into a `PostCard` component with clear actions 
  (e.g., `like()`, `save()`, `open_comments()`) to favor single responsibility and reusability.
- **Typing & lint-friendly**: type hints and docstrings added; methods return self or domain objects for fluent usage.
- **Capcha issue** This issue can be covered by `wait_to_handle_capture_manually = true` and after that, handle it manually 
  while the test is waiting 120 seconds. I'd say that the CAPTCHA issue will not happen when tests are run just a few times.
- **Password encryption** It's a good thing to keep sensitive data like passwords, etc., encrypted to avoid data leakage.
- **PlaywrightDriver** This adapter was added for dependency inversion. Also, it'll provide the ability to easily add unit tests for pages.
- **Locators with text**: The text needs to be placed in the localization classes later to support different languages
